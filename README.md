## lawyers.txt
Please do a more thorough search before sending DMCA takedown notices, especially look at my profile first.

As I said earlier, please contact me first before taking actions, no matter how agitated your client is.

Please allow up to 30 business days before taking action, I will get back in touch as soon as possible.

I know you want to finish your task fast, but I'm human. I make mistakes. I want to correct any of my mistakes. Just let me do so. 

If you contact me first, I'll do what you or your client want me to do (removal of said content and/or the entire repository if applicable) and both you, your client and I will be happy, no drama.

Hell, you don't even have to format it or anything. Just send me a link to the file(s) you want me to remove and a proof that you own the said content. Just be nice, no need to throw temper tantrum.

## What the mail should contain
- A proof that you're lawfully authorized to send the notice
- The link to the repository or the file(s) in question
- A formal paragraph describing that this is indeed a DMCA notice and not a friendly heads-up (which is also appreciated, by the way)

Proof includes, but is not limited to:
- Your portfolio or website (in case of copyrighted works)
- Your company's website (in case of copyrighted codes)
- Legal documents (case files included, if required)
- Your code on other platform posted **before** the notice **WITH** the publishing date visible (in case of plagiarism or stolen codes, codes posted **after** the notice cannot be verified thus will be ignored. Minimum 5 days prior to notice)
- Research papers (in case of stolen publications or unauthorized copy of research papers)
- ISBN number or Amazon/Google Books page link (in case of stolen publications, such as e-books)

Unlawful use of DMCA notices will be appealed and then blacklisted (such as to take down projects you or your client doesn't like but has no right to, or doing "hush job" -- process of using DMCA takedown notices to silence someone).

Any and all DMCA notices should be sent to `torbjornl76+dmca@gmail.com`.

Use subject line "DMCA notice". Just copy-and-paste this.

# Closing words
**If you are so bad at reading and if you are willing to risk someone's future career over a dispute they're willing to resolve peacefully, you should be ashamed of yourself.** Please. Just let me know what is bothering you or your client, and I will do what I can. It isn't hard.
